### SEI Project Two: Stocked
Stocked is a live app that functions to track food by logging a digital
inventory. The idea of Stocked was inspired during quarantine with my
family since we are buying groceries every two weeks for five people
it is essential we don't let food get wasted and go bad.
Stocked is user friendly for all age groups but is targeted for
people 20+ years old.

#### User Story:
Are you buying produce you're excited to cook meals with and then forget about it in your fridge and it gets moldy? Stress no further, with Stocked you can track your food and plan recipes based on the produce you have. It's hard to keep track of all the food you have, but with Stocked we'd like to help make that easier for you. 

#### Features:
- Log in, Sign up, and Log Out
- Create a new food item
- Edit a food item
- Delete a food item
- Input up to 3 recipes and displays recipe url preview
- Input expiration date, item name, price of item, and quantity.


#### If I had more time:
There are many features I'd like to add to this
app such as a chart/graph to visualize the past produce the user has
had. I would also like to add a compost section that would function
based on the type of food the user has, the compost section would
let the user know if it can be composted. There is a feature on Stocked
to input the expiration date of an item and I would like to add to this
by alerting the user when that item is near it's expiration.
